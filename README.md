# Loan-Prediction-Classification-Model
This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict loan approval status. The model uses various applicant features to determine the likelihood of loan approval.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that classifies whether a loan will be approved or not based on specific applicant details. The dataset includes features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

**ApplicantIncome:** The income of the loan applicant.

**CoapplicantIncome:** The income of the co-applicant (if any).

**LoanAmount:** The amount of the loan requested.

**Loan_Amount_Term:** The term of the loan in months.

**Credit_History:** Credit history of the applicant (1 if the applicant has a credit history, 0 otherwise).

**Gender:** Gender of the applicant.

**Married:** Marital status of the applicant.

**Dependents:** Number of dependents of the applicant.

**Education:** Educational level of the applicant.

**Self_Employed:** Whether the applicant is self-employed.

**Property_Area:** The area where the property is located (Urban, Semi-Urban, Rural).

# Steps Followed 
- **Data Processing** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Model Selection:** Training and evaluating different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing the performance of models using cross-validation and selecting the best-performing model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the chosen model to improve performance.
